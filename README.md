# MangoTwo

This repo is based on the book Mastering phoenix framework by Shankah Dhanasekaran. In the book we build an e-commerce site used to sell fresh fruit products. This repo may not follow the book step by step as there could be cases of experimentation of newer technologies. :)

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
